## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r read the data}
read.csv("1A_Practical_49_Sourie_Sr.csv")
```

:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```
